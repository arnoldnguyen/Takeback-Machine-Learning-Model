An example of this would be a spring concert or a finals prep event. Series Program - A Series Program is an on-campus event that takes place more than once and up to seven times. These events have either the same or very similar missions and are connected in some way. Examples of Series Programs are speaker series,a weekly programming class,or a week-long cultural event.Trip: Conference or Team Competition - A Trip that is a Conference or Competition is an off-campus event that has a competitive nature or is a conference. Some examples are national dance competitions,regional medical conferences,debate competitions,or business conferences.Trip: NOT a Conference or Team Competition - A Non-Conference or Competition trip is any off-campusevent that does not classify as a competition or conference. This could be any kind of trip such as a trip to The Museum of Natural History,community service trips,or a visit to The White House. Series Trip: Conference or Team Competition - This would be an event that qualifies as a stand alone trip that is a Conference or Team Competition but occurs more than once and at most six times. For example,a series of three conferences that occur in three consecutive weeks or a national gaming tournament that occurs throughout the semester at different locations.Series Trip: NOT a Conference or Team Competition - This would be an event that qualifies as a stand alone trip that is not a Conference or Team Competition and occurs more than once but at most six times. This could be several weekly visits to an elementary school for an enrichment program or a few hiking trips at different locations around the Tri-State area.Publication - These are media publications meant for distribution around campus or online. Satirical magazines or medical journals published by a pre-med club are both examples of this. Only one series program is able to be funded per semester.Please ensure that you properly categorize your programs,as it allows us to provide the most accurate funding to your club. If you are unsure about what your program should be categorized as please email us at rusa.allocations@gmail.com or come to one of our Budget Help Nights on March XX and XX.","Organization Name(if your club's name contains ""Rutgers"" you do not need to include it here. | i.e. ""Rutgers Debate Club"" should be entered as ""Debate Club"")",SABO Account Number (Provisional Organizations without an account number should write the word PROVISIONAL in this box),Mission of Organization (from your group's constitution),Name of Contact Person,Position,Contact Email (must be checked daily),Organization Advisor(assigned by Student Involvement),Do You Have Approved Storage Space on Campus,"If so,where is that storage located?","In order to ensure the programs you need funding for the most are funded,enter your budget requests in priority order.
