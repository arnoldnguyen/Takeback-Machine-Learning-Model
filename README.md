The RUSA Allocations Board is an affiliated committee of RUSA that operates separately from RUSA and is responsible for the allocation of funds to registered Rutgers University Student Organizations as well as various registered events on an as-needed basis.

The goal of the Allocations Board is to promote and support the diversity of programming made available to all Rutgers University Students through the fair and efficient use of the student activities fee.  RUSA Allocations provides over a million dollars worth of program funding to over 400 different organizations at Rutgers University-New Brunswick campus.  

With the rise of inflation and also the creation of new organizations on Rutgers campus, funding clubs has been increasingly more difficult over the years. Because of this, a cut across all student organizations has to be applied, to the point of a club getting only ~ 65 cents for every dollar they request. Of course the simple solution is to raise the student organization budget for funding, but students are understandably very price elastic/sensitive regarding their already expensive tuition.

A large issue with club funding is that clubs tend to overrequest -- around 30% of funding disappears because clubs overrequest, do not use that money, and the money is returned back into Rutgers, effectively disappearing. This is valuable information because if there is a way to minimize overrequests, we can effectively increase club funding without having to increase the student organization budget, thus affecting student tuition.

This project serves to minimize takeback costs, allowing for more dynamic caps that will allow for more efficient and effective funding on Rutgers University New Brunswick Campus. While it is impossible to prevent overrequesting as a whole, minimizing overrequests will allow more clubs to get the funding they need.
